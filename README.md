## Project Overview

This project documents a simulated penetration test against the OWASP Juice Shop. The goal was to identify and analyze vulnerabilities, assess their potential business impact, and provide clear recommendations for remediation.

### Methodology

The assessment followed a standard penetration testing methodology:

1.  **Reconnaissance:** Gathering information about the application and its underlying technology stack.
2.  **Scanning & Enumeration:** Using automated tools and manual techniques to identify potential points of entry, services, and vulnerabilities.
3.  **Exploitation:** Attempting to exploit identified vulnerabilities to confirm their existence and assess their impact.
4.  **Post-Exploitation:** (Not applicable in this scope) Determining the extent of access and potential for lateral movement.
5.  **Reporting:** Documenting all findings, providing a risk rating, and detailing remediation steps.

### Tools Used

* **Burp Suite:** For intercepting and modifying HTTP/S traffic.
* **OWASP ZAP:** For automated scanning and spidering.
* **Nmap:** For initial port and service enumeration.
* **Web Browser Developer Tools:** For client-side code inspection.
